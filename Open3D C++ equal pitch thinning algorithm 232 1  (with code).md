##  First, the principle of the algorithm 

###  1. Overview of the principle 

  Equal spacing thinning algorithm: Set the sampling spacing in the original point cloud data to, first select 1 point at the beginning of the data; then keep 1 point per interval until all points are screened. The advantages of the equal spacing thinning method are simple, fast and efficient, but the disadvantage is that it cannot better retain the micro-terrain features.

##  First, the principle of the algorithm 

###  1. Implementation process 

  The RGB-D camera can measure the depth of each pixel. After measuring the depth, the RGB-D camera usually completes the pairing between the depth depth and the color map according to the placement of each camera during production, and outputs the one-to-one corresponding color map and depth map. We can read the color information and distance information at the same position, calculate the 3D camera coordinates of the pixels, and generate a point cloud. The calculation formula is: in the formula, it is the depth value, and the unit is meters; it is the scaling multiple of the depth value; it is the pixel coordinate, which is the 3D point cloud coordinate corresponding to the pixel; it is the focal length of the camera, and it is the optical center of the camera, which is the so-called internal parameter. The pose of the camera is also called the external parameter of the camera, which will change with the camera movement. Knowing the inner parameter can generate a point cloud from the color map and depth map, and knowing the outer parameter can splice the point cloud generated by the color map and depth map measured at different positions of the same object into a complete ground object point cloud.

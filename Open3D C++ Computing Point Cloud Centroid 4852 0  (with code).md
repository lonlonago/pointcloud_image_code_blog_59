##  First, the principle of the algorithm 

###  1. Calculation formula 

  The center of mass refers to the center of mass, which is considered to be the imaginary point where the mass of the object is concentrated at this point. Usually, the coordinates of the center of mass of the object are calculated as follows: Among them, the coordinates of each mass point are the corresponding mass of the mass point. 

###  2. Computing in the point cloud 

  When calculating the point cloud centroid, let the above formula, then the point cloud centroid coordinate calculation formula is as follows:

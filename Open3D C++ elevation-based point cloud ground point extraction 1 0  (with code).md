##  First, the principle of the algorithm 

###  1. Overview of the principle 

  In the area where the fluctuation is small and the point cloud does not contain outlier noise in the local range of the ground, the ground point and the non-ground point can be divided and extracted according to the height difference between each point and the lowest point.

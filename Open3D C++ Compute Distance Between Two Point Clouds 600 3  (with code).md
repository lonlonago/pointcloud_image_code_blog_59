##  Introduction to the algorithm 

###  1. Main function 

  The ComputePointCloudDistance function in Open3D provides a way to calculate the distance from the source point cloud to the target point cloud, computing the distance of the point cloud. That is, it calculates the distance from each point in the source point cloud to the nearest point in the target point cloud.

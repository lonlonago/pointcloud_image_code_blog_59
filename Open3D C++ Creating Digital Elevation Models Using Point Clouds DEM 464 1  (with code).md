##  I. DEM 

   Digital Elevation Model (Digital Elevation Model), referred to as DEM, is a digital simulation of ground terrain (that is, the digital expression of terrain surface morphology) through limited terrain elevation data. It is an entity ground model that represents ground elevation in the form of a set of ordered numerical arrays. It is a branch of Digital Terrain Model (DTM), from which various other terrain characteristic values can be derived. Generally speaking, DTM is a spatial distribution that describes a variety of geomorphological factors including elevation, such as slope, aspect, slope change rate, etc., including linear and nonlinear combinations. Among them, DEM is a zero-order simple single-item digital geomorphological model. Other geomorphological characteristics such as slope, aspect, and slope change rate can be derived on the basis of DEM.

>  The above code realizes the format of converting the point cloud into DEM and saving it as a point cloud. The DEM model can be generated by using Delaunay triangulation to build a TIN triangulation network. The Delaunay triangulation network is realized in the CloudCompare software, so the software is directly used to generative model.
